## Moth-Eye Antireflection Biomimicry Applications Lattice

1. Solar Efficiency: Moth-eye AR on panels/glass → 3–7% absorption gain (Tesla roof, Mars arrays)
   Benefit: Max photon harvest, dust-resistant

2. Displays & Optics: MOSMITE/g.moth™ films → <0.1% reflection (vehicle/medical screens, Optimus visor)
   Advantage: Glare-free readability

3. IR & Sensors: Broadband IR AR → thermal imaging, low-light vision (xAI robotics)
   Extension: Mars navigation, fog penetration

4. Antifog & Protective: Combined self-cleaning → goggles, face shields
   Application: MercyOS hardware hygiene

5. LEDs & Energy: Light extraction + flow optimization → efficient devices
   Advantage: Reduced losses in lighting/batteries
